                        <br>
                        <p class="description">This restaurant (formerly known as Al-Amnah Restoran and rebranded as Selangor Mansion), located in the bustling streets of Masjid India, is popular for their huge hot delicious mess that is its Roti Canai Banjir Special. Their acclaim to fame is also due to the fact that this dish can only be found here at this modest restaurant. The “special” part is due to the addition of two half boiled eggs on top of TWO roti canai drowned in thick dhal and spicy sambal. Hence, the banjir part of the name. However, don’t forget to add in the pepper and soy sauce in so as not to leave the eggs feeling tasteless as well as to mix the entire plate thoroughly (some of you may disagree and not find the mess enticing but trust me, it is really good).</p>

                        <br>
                        <p class="description">Being one of the more popular stalls at the edge of Kampung Sungai Penchala, 123 Corner is where people from the village and even the neighbouring TTDI come together for their breakfast fill of roti canai ever morning. Sometimes it is also their choice of meal for lunch and dinner. Claiming a recipe that’s been passed down from generation to generation, the stall boasts a menu ranging from nasi lemak to its roti canai. The roti canai is super soft on the inside but a little bit flaky on the outside, making it just perfect. Served with a small bowl of dhall, the roti is easy to tear and fold before being dipped into the gravy. The roti was prepared promptly on a plate, fluffy and light, with just the slightest drizzle of oil. Portion is however, noticeably smaller than the other places listed here but for a price of RM1.20 per roti, it’s probably worth it. </p>

                        <br>
                        <p class="description">Lying smack in the middle of Kuala Lumpur is this humble stall whose menu consist of only nasi lemak and roti canai. What’s interesting about this place is the low prices of the food despite its location. I’ve come up with the hypothesis that it’s probably cheap as a sedekah since it’s located very close to a mosque. Only three variations of roti canai are served here: plain, roti telur, and roti sardine. And they’re all made fresh based on orders. Unlike other restaurants, Pak Hassan only uses chicken feet curry for the roti canai gravy. Tourists may not find the idea of chicken feet in a small bowl very appetising but it is a truly Asian dish. The curry is put in a huge steel pot and customers are free to scoop the gravy themselves according to their liking. A plain roti canai and a glass of tea will only set you back about RM2.00. Now who said everything is expensive in Kuala Lumpur?
